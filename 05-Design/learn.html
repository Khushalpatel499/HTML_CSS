 //Responsive Design:
 1.user have good ui experience in respect of device.
 2. there are three way to achieve this responsivness:
    a. Responsive web design :using css rule
    b. Dynamic serving: server will send file according to device type now the problem is that we have to maintain multiple files
    c. Separate mobile website: seperate website for mobile only it start from m.facebook new url.
 3. in first two the file url is same but the  server decide , in first only css change html,js is same while in second html,css,js are different but server decide which file send to device.
 
 step 1: Measurement units for responsive designs:
  1. abosolute :px,in,cm        2. Relative:%,(vh,vw(used in dimension)),(rem,em(fontsize,text))
  3. still the fluid layout is difficult becuase what make an image good at this screen is not compuslory at other screen .it can pixelate the image.
  4. while using percentage we used min-width and max-width so they don't pixalate alot means shrink or sharnk alot.
  5. other is rem (with respect to root font size) ,em(with respect to the element font size) for text.
  6. like for top level of website use px and for it component use rem and for their text,para use em.
  7. read about elastic layout also.
  
  // viewport meta tag

1. how browser change the view port according to the device so the first step it will look at the virtual viewput and zoom out till it achieve the device measurement.
2. it not always success so we don't need to depend on browser
3. use viewport meta tag and content quaries.

//Media Queries:
1. introduce css3, it give more flexibility,freedom and control to decide which css rule should apply based on the device type and device properties
2. it will decide on two type:
        a. Media type:screen,print,speech,all
        b. Media-properties: width,height,resolution
3. syntax: @media screen and (max-width:600px){}

//Desktop first and mobile first(two approach when design website)
1. Desktop : first desktop then ipad and then move mobile version.
2. mobile: first mobile then other.
