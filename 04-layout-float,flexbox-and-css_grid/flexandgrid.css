/* 1.flex and grid are used to create flexible and responsive websites
2. flex full name flexible box layout.
3. means adjacet elemment with respect to container or childeren with respect to parent.
4. they are many way to arrange by position also but flex help to do with smooth and less code.
5. default orientaiton in flex container is horizontal.
6. but we can change by flex direction .
7. we can change the order of child container also using order in child container.
8. if we set some width to childrens and add more children then it get shrink and not get their effective width.
9. to solve this problem we used flex-wrap property.
10. by default it is nowrap means all the children are wrap in single line so to present them in multiple line we should select wrap or wrap-reverse    but then it can overflow the container.
11.wrap from left to right and wrapreverse right to left.
12. if there few children and still there are few space remaining then the children can cover that space by flex-grow.
13. let there are two children and both are of 100px and 100px width and the continer widht is 300 px and now 100px is free so set the flex-grow to both the children with 1 means they dived both free space take 50 each.
14.flex gorw depend on the flex direction.
15. we have flex-shrink also if there is not that much space is available.
16.justified content is used alignment items in flex box like begning ,end,or distributed the space equally between them .

17. justified content decide the alignment across the main axis 
18. main axis is basically the flex-direction by defualt is row.
19.justify-content take 5values 1.flex-start 2.flex-end 3.center 4.space-around 5.space-between
