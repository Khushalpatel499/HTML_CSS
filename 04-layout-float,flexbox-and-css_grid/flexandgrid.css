/* 1.flex and grid are used to create flexible and responsive websites
2. flex full name flexible box layout.
3. means adjacet elemment with respect to container or childeren with respect to parent.
4. they are many way to arrange by position also but flex help to do with smooth and less code.
5. default orientaiton in flex container is horizontal.
6. but we can change by flex direction .
7. we can change the order of child container also using order in child container.
8. if we set some width to childrens and add more children then it get shrink and not get their effective width.
9. to solve this problem we used flex-wrap property.
10. by default it is nowrap means all the children are wrap in single line so to present them in multiple line we should select wrap or wrap-reverse    but then it can overflow the container.
11.wrap from left to right and wrapreverse right to left.
12. if there few children and still there are few space remaining then the children can cover that space by flex-grow.
13. let there are two children and both are of 100px and 100px width and the continer widht is 300 px and now 100px is free so set the flex-grow to both the children with 1 means they dived both free space take 50 each.
14.flex gorw depend on the flex direction.
15. we have flex-shrink also if there is not that much space is available.
16.justified content is used alignment items in flex box like begning ,end,or distributed the space equally between them .

17. justified content decide the alignment across the main axis 
18. main axis is basically the flex-direction by defualt is row.
19.justify-content take 5values 1.flex-start 2.flex-end 3.center 4.space-around 5.space-between
20. now align item it is used to align item across the cross axis.
21. cross axis is perpendicular to main axis.
22. it take five values: 1.flex-start 2.flex-end 3.center 4.baseline: it is align to all the children to the base line let supppose childeren have margin 10,20,30 and by apply this all aling to 30px 5.stretch: it is default value means it strench across the cross axis if we not provide height of child then it will strech to the whole container.

// Word overflow-Wrap
1. overflow-wrap : break-word.
2. It take two value 1.normal 2.break-word.



//Gradient.
1. the combination of colors and transitionn happen from color to colours is called gradient effect.
2. using pradient we can create cool background.
3. to apply graddient.  background-image:linear-gradient(red,blue); all these are colors tops
4. the transition happen from one color to another is happen in mid to change this use blue 20% means blue start from 20%.
5. there two color so each color take half place by default means 0 to 100 for them and if we write blue 20% then it will start from the upper color 20% area similar if we wirte blue 120% then it take from 120% and after 100% red take 20% more.
6. other way is to specified in px also background-imgae: linear-gradient(red ,blue 30px;
7. we can also play with direction currently it is in  down. or in degree also.
8. we can set as backgroud short hand way to reapeat : background:  reapeating-linear-gradient(red,blue 10px);
9. there are two type of gradient linear and radial.


//Pseudo:
1. it is a keyword that used to select an element along with selector base on a specific state (ex: hover)
2. we are discuss here: link,active,visited,target  
3.target is basically when we click the it go that and apply effect.
4. using target we can do light box animation


Pseudo elements;
1. it help to style an element or style specific part of element.
2. ::first-line ,::first-letter
3. before and after pesudeo element used to add content before/after the content of the element.
4. what ever we add in before or after is add in inline 
5. it add virtual element becuase that is not add in html code.
6. by this we can add icon , use style for before and after ,style in list
7.
