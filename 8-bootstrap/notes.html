 2.development time reduces.
 3. bootstrap,materialize css,semantic css
 4.pros: popular,save time,lotes of styles,reponsive,customisable,great support
 5. cons: it is bluky
 6. there are two ways to add bootstrap in project 1. download complete code 2 use bootstrap cdn(content delivery network)

 8. it consider mobile in mind 
     deive break point

//bootstrap creating system layout:
1. grid system: contain container it container contain row and each row contain column
2. every grid in bootstrap is 12 column grid.
3. use container-fluid class to it occupied complete width
4.now currently it take all 12 column and now i want only 4 col then col-4
5. this for xs devices and all other above this but if i want that here it occupied only in second row 6 column but in i want in sm screen it occupied only 4 column.then do thi col-sm-4 it will apply all sm and above devices.
6. now we see display layout in bootstrap. syntac: d-{breakpoint}-{value}
ex: d-xs-block
7. now see margin and padding in css syntax-{property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}
ex:mt-2
8. sass is basically syntactically awsome style sheet
9. now see border syntax border in class.
ex: border
not border = border-0
10.bootstrap doesn't have a class for width of boarder.
11. when we try to change border width in our css then it not change becuase bootstrap write imporant so we also write imporant but still no change becuase we link our file before bootstrap and we know in css rule are fromm top to bottom so link after bootstrap.
//. Bootstrap commponents:
1.ex:button,list,card syntax: btn
2. we can also use btn with anchor tag then specified <a role='button'>
