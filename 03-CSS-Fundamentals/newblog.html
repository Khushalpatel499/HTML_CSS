            sites with a clean user interface? While most of us would reply with
            an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill
            that goes into making a website attractive and user-friendly. The
            secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of
            front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!

              <h4 class="uppercase cursive">COMMENTING</h4>
              <p>
                Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
                programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
                programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of
                project you create. With proper comments and organised files its
                always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where
                things are at and how they work.

                from browser add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices
                available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really
                productive web tools that’ll help you improve your front-end
                designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet,
                Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web
                developers.

                Refactor Your Code From Time To Time
              </h4>
              <p>
                By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code
                without tampering with its functionality. This will improve the
                quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often
                you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner
                and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one
                of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is
                that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.

              <h4 class="uppercase cursive">Version Control</h4>
              <p>
                As a developer, version control is something that you must know
                about. Version control systems let you keep track of changes
                made to the code over time. And not just this, they also make it
                easy to revert back to an earlier version if you screw something
                up. Thus using verion control will save you some sleepless
                nights for sure. One of the most widely used version control
                systems is Git. Thus knowing git has been a requirement for
                almost every development job these days.

            While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end
            designer, in the long run, you must always remember two things while
            designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget
            to create your signature style.
